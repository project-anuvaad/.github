Anuvaad is an AI based open source Document Translation Platform to _digitize and translate_ documents in Indic languages at scale. Anuvaad provides easy-to-edit capabilities on top the plug & play NMT models. Separate instances of Anuvaad are deployed to [Diksha](https://diksha.anuvaad.org/) (NCERT), [Supreme Court of India](https://government.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/technology/ai-backed-suvas-translation-tool-intended-to-make-legalese-simpler-court-proceedings-faster-law-minister/102648151)(SUVAS) and [Supreme Court of Bangladesh](https://www.tbsnews.net/bangladesh/court/supreme-court-launches-translation-software-amar-vasha-204100) (Amar Vasha).

Anuvaad is an open-sourced project funded by `EkStep foundation`.

It was bootstrapped by EkStep Foundation in late 2019 as a solution to enable easier translation of legal documents from English to Indic languages & vice-versa. Creating Anuvaad platform allowed legal entities to digitize & translate the Orders/Judgements using an easy to use user interface.
